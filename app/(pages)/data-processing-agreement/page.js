            7. RELEVANT RECORDS AND AUDIT RIGHTS
          </h1>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-base mb-3">
            Customer may audit Tempo’s compliance with its obligations under
            this DPA up to once per year and on such other occasions as may be
            required by Data Protection Laws and Regulations.Tempo will
            contribute to such audits by providing Customer with the information
            and assistance that Tempo considers appropriate in the circumstances
            and reasonably necessary to conduct the audit. To request an audit,
            Customer must submit a proposed audit plan to Tempo at least twenty
            (20) days in advance of the proposed audit date and any third-party
            auditor must sign a customary non-disclosure agreement mutually
            acceptable to the Parties (such acceptance not to be unreasonably
            withheld) providing for the confidential treatment of all
            information exchanged in connection with the audit and any reports
            regarding the results or findings thereof. The proposed audit plan
            must describe the proposed scope, duration, and start date of the
            audit. Tempo will review the proposed audit plan and provide
            Customer with any concerns or questions (for example, any request
            for information that could compromise Tempo security, privacy,
            employment or other relevant policies).{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-base mb-3">
            Tempo will work cooperatively with Customer to agree on a final
            audit plan. Nothing in this Section 8 shall require Tempo to breach
            any duties of confidentiality.If the controls or measures to be
            assessed in the requested audit are addressed in an SOC 2 Type 2,
            ISO, NIST or similar audit report performed by a qualified
            third-party auditor within twelve (12) months of Customer’s audit
            request and Tempo has confirmed there have been no known material
            changes in the controls audited since the date of such report,
            Customer agrees to accept such report in lieu of requesting an audit
            of such controls or measures.The audit must be conducted during
            regular business hours, subject to the agreed final audit plan and
            Tempo’s safety, security or other relevant policies, and may not
            unreasonably interfere with Tempo business activities. Any audits
            are at Customer’s sole expense. Customer shall reimburse Tempo for
            any time expended by Tempo and any third parties in connection with
            any audits or inspections under this Section 8 at Tempo’s
            then-current professional services rates, which shall be made
            available to Customer upon request. Customer will be responsible for
            any fees charged by any auditor appointed by Customer to execute any
            such audit.
