          accordance with Company’s then current published documentation and

          live representative.

          responsible for connecting to and using the Services made available to
          it in accordance with this Agreement, (b) cooperate with Company to

          ways to contact the Company and its live representatives, as
          appropriate or required by law or regulation. The Services, including
          the chat bot and related AI, ML, and NLP technologies, are rapidly
          evolving. Company and its licensors and suppliers are working to
          improve the Services to make them more accurate, reliable, safe, and
          beneficial. However, given the probabilistic nature of AI and ML
          underlying the Services, use of the Services may in some situations
          result in errors or omissions and not accurately reflect real people,
          language, events, or facts. Customer should evaluate the accuracy and
          reliability of the Services as appropriate for it and its use cases
          and applications.
